#### an information Pokemon App written in kotlin using the PokeAPI


PokeDex is an Android application that utilizes the PokeAPI(https://pokeapi.co/) to display information about Pokemons and their respective types. The PokeAPI is a RESTful API that provides a vast amount of data related to the Pokemon universe.

With this application, a user can look up a particular Pokemon by name, and the application will retrieve relevant data from the PokeAPI to display on the screen. This could include information like the Pokemon's name, type, height, weight, and other stats.

In addition to displaying information about Pokemon, the application also allows users to add their favorite Pokemons to a "favorites" list, which they can then access later. This feature is implemented using SharedPreferences, so that the favorites persist between sessions.

Overall, this project provides a simple and user-friendly interface for accessing information about Pokemons using the PokeAPI, while also adding the convenience of being able to save favorite Pokemons for future reference.
